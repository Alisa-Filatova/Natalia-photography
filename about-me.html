                <p class="about-me__text">
                    I am a creative newborn, wedding and family portrait 
                    photographer based in a beautiful nature in California that 
                    enjoys working at home and (well who wouldn't) away!<br> 
                    I have shot weddings and other events all over the California.
                </p>
 
                <p class="about-me__text">
                    I am a happy, creative person that loves to make beautiful, natural, 
                    soft, romantic and thoughtful images that reflect my artistic style.<br> 
                    I am a wife to one of americans finest, a mum to a two beautiful girls 
                    who is a sucker for a good love story, (I have been known to cry at many 
                    films... and TV adverts!!! You may even notice I often shed a few tears 
                    behind my camera when capturing people in love!)<br>
                    I love a happy home full of flowers, candles, laughter, life and 
                    lots of music.
                </p>
 
                <p class="about-me__text">
                    After working hard to get better and better with my camera, 
                    I decided to turn my passion of photography into a business. 
                    There is nothing more satisfying to me than spending a day with 
                    my husband, family and friends BUT spending a day behind the camera... 
                    well, that's a very close second! 
                    I never get tired of capturing a family's love or hearing the laughs of 
                    children after they are done with a silly pose, or the look I see in a 
                    client's face after handing over their images. 
                    I hope that one day soon, I will be able to bring my love of photos into 
                    your home that will fill you with tiny, captured memories that will last 
                    a lifetime...
                </p>
